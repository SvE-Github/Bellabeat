Data in Motion: Taking a Step Forward with Bellabeat

Google Data Analytics - Capstone Project
by Stefan van Ettinger

Introduction 
Throughout my journey of completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course on Coursera, I've been introduced to data analysis and gained valuable skills. This project will help me solidify my knowledge and finally put it into practice. Furthermore, I challenged myself to acquire new skills by completing this very project.

The following skills will be used:

- Applying the practices and procedures associated with the data analysis process
- Formatting notebooks with Markdown
- Performing data analysis with R
- Using AI to aid with more complicated (or new) syntax
- Understanding notebooks and explanations of other data analysts in order to improve own work
- Showcasing results with visualizations

Two files are attached:

- Notebook (.ipynb)
- Code (.r)

Enjoy reading and kind regards,
